        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This article is intended for teams using or planning to use AI on
          their websites and apps. It provides an overview of risk,
          requirements, governance, and how to achieve compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of obligations fall on providers or developers of
          high-risk AI systems but developers of apps, including those using AI
          for educational purposes, may be involved in work that is classed as
          minimal risk, and is therefore subject to (lighter) obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following summary of risk and requirements is taken from the
          <a
            href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence"
            >summary</a
          >
          provided by the European Parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new rules establish obligations for providers and users depending
          on the level of risk from artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <h3>Unacceptable risk</h3>
        <p>Don't do these things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cognitive behavioural manipulation of people or specific vulnerable
            groups
          </li>
          <li>Social scoring</li>
          <li>Biometric identification and categorisation of people</li>
          <li>
            Real-time and remote biometric identification systems, such as
            facial recognition
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Article 5 of the act covers
          <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/5/"
            >prohibited AI practices</a
          >
          in detail.
        </p>
        <h3>High risk</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Category 1</em> is concerned with products such as lifts,
          medicines and planes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some areas of <em>Category 2</em> are specialised but others may be of
          relevance to developers of certain kinds of software.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are involved in any of the following, find out what your
          obligations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Management and operation of critical infrastructure</li>
          <li>Education and vocational training</li>
          <li>Employment, worker management and access to self-employment</li>
          <li>
            Access to and enjoyment of essential private services and public
            services and benefits
          </li>
          <li>Law enforcement</li>
          <li>Migration, asylum and border control management</li>
          <li>
            Assistance in legal interpretation and application of the law.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Transparency requirements</h2>
        <h3>Use of Generative AI</h3>
        <p>
          While not classified as high-risk, the use of Generative AI, like
          ChatGPT, will have to comply with transparency requirements and EU
          copyright law.
        </p>
        <p>You can comply by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disclosing that the content was generated by AI</li>
          <li>
            Designing the model to prevent it from generating illegal content
          </li>
          <li>Publishing summaries of copyrighted data used for training</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            High-impact general-purpose AI models that might pose systemic risk,
            such as the more advanced AI model GPT-4, would have to undergo
            thorough evaluations and any serious incidents would have to be
            reported to the European Commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Content that is either generated or modified with the help of AI -
            images, audio or video files (for example deepfakes) - need to be
            clearly labelled as AI generated so that users are aware when they
            come across such content.
          </p>
          <cite
            ><a
              href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence"

            ></cite
          >
        </blockquote>
        <h3>How should AI generated content be labelled?</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/v4mfz"
            >What label should be applied to content produced by generative
            AI?</a
          >
          by Epstein et al., considered how nine labels are perceived by people
          in the US, Mexico, Brazil, India, and China.
        </p>
        <p>The paper is worth a read, here is a flavour of it:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>AI generated</strong>,
            <strong>Generated with an AI tool</strong>, and
            <strong>AI Manipulated</strong> are the terms that participants most
            consistently associated with content that was generated using AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if the goal is to identify content that is misleading
            (e.g., our second research question), these terms perform quite
            poorly. Instead, <strong>Deepfake</strong> and
            <strong>Manipulated</strong>
            are the terms most consistently associated with content that is
            potentially misleading.
          </p>
          <p>[<em>Ed. the labels have been highlighted for emphasis.</em>]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Governance</h2>
        <p>How will the AI Act be implemented?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The
            <a
              href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office"
              >AI Office</a
            >
            will be established, sitting within the Commission, to monitor the
            effective implementation and compliance of
            <abbr title="General purpose AI">GPAI</abbr> model providers.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Next steps</h2>
        <p>
          For the majority of app developers, the AI Act will not apply until
          thirty-six months from the date of the entry into force of the AI Act:
          <a
            href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/responsibilities-of-european-commission-ai-office/"
            >2 August 2027</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although that may seem a long way off, compliance may not be trivial;
          we advise you to begin assessing your responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an appendix to the summary, there are a number of use cases you may
          find useful.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Education and vocational training</strong>: AI systems
            determining access, admission or assignment to educational and
            vocational training institutions at all levels. Evaluating learning
            outcomes, including those used to steer the student’s learning
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assessing the appropriate level of education for an individual.
            Monitoring and detecting prohibited student behaviour during tests.
          </p>
          <p>[<em>Ed. the use case has been highlighted for emphasis.</em>]</p>
        </blockquote>
