        <p>
          This article makes the case for tackling complexity in web app
          development by creating multiple apps.
        </p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
          Let's imagine how employees at an intergovernmental site monitoring
          carbon emissions might interact with their data.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Big picture</strong>: charts, executive summaries, key
            stats, takeaways
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analysis</strong>: interactive charts, models, scenarios,
            generating reports and new requirements, summarising data, picking
            out key data points and writing takeaways
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data entry</strong>: inputting data, overseeing ingestion of
            data from disparate sources, editing data, validating data, fact
            checking reports
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Regulation</strong>: auditing data, verifying data,
            source-checking
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Political</strong>: ensuring commitments are made and
            standards adhered to, raising concerns, identifying problems,
            issuing warnings
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Public</strong>: oversight, providing criticism and feedback
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The data may change little but the people using them, and the access
          they need, will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem for the development team (and we use this term broadly to
          include everyone contributing to building, marketing and promoting the
          site), is to determine who sees what, when, and why. Nor is this a one
          way street; depending on their requirements, our analysts,
          statisticians, politicians and public may need to give up information
          about themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it better to create multiple apps (data entry, analytics,
          dashboard, etc.) or variations on a single app? Whatever the decision
          (we will be putting the case for multiple apps), understanding the
          needs of users is necessary for writing less code and designing
          simpler interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          If teams ignore differences at the outset, contradictions accumulate
          and complexity increases.
        </p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          How do we prevent this from happening? The first step is to consider
          all possible user flows and place them in groups. The number of groups
          is critical; the fewer the better so long as no one group becomes a
          bucket for miscellany.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's another way to break down our
          <a
            href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/building-user-segmentation-matrix-foster-cross-org-alignment/"
            >user segments</a
          >:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Who needs what data?</strong> Some users require high-level
            summaries (executives, public), while others need in-depth
            interaction with the data (analysts, auditors).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How frequently do they interact with the app?</strong>
            For example, data entry might happen daily, while audits might occur
            quarterly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What level of technical expertise do they have?</strong>
            Data entry operators might need a simplified interface, while
            analysts may require complex data manipulation tools.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This work is not trivial. It benefits from expertise in UI and UX but
          ideally it should involve disparate team members, including people who
          understand human behaviour, data manipulation, HTML, screen readers,
          accessibility, performance, security, SEO, marketing, etc. It's a long
          list.
        </p>
        <h3>The matrix of needs</h3>
        <p>
          Writing down the needs of different users is a pretty clear
          requirement. How else would we know what to build? Once we have that
          information, we can use it in multiple ways because we are programmers
          and designers and studiers of human behaviour. We can show where there
          is overlap, which items are unique, what is universal, and we can rank
          requirements in multiple ways such as necessity, risk, development
          time, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>
          Not everyone likes meetings but without informed, critical discussion,
          problems will emerge that could have been prevented. Here are some of
          the benefits of (long) meetings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job titles become less important</li>
          <li>
            Everyone gets a chance to speak (if the meeting is sufficiently
            long)
          </li>
          <li>Solutions bubble up as workable ideas replace opinions</li>
          <li>Consensus is derived not imposed</li>
          <li>New thinking emerges</li>
          <li>Collaboration improves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          It's a principle, not only held by developers, that it's a bad idea to
          repeat yourself. This is a good argument in favour of components.
          Components are used multiple times. A button component might be used
          hundreds, or thousands of times, and it will allow for a certain
          amount of variety.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's tempting to have one app because it feels like a lot of effort to
          have more. But it needn't be, especially if a team knows why they have
          multiple apps, and are comfortable building and maintaining them
          (working from, perhaps, a template generator). Apps aren't that hard
          to build; the problem is what to show and what not to show, and to
          whom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to stop a visitor going where you don't want them to go,
          or from doing what you don't want them to, is to remove that
          particular option. This is also a good rule for development teams.
        </p>
        <p>Here is how we might tackle two of our apps.</p>
        <h4>The dashboard app</h4>
        <p>
          In our hypothetical app, we make everyone's life easier, by building a
          separate app for the dashboard. It consumes data (it's read only), it
          might not need a menu, and it can expand to fill the screen. It won't
          be hard to display data by region, and to work out how much the
          authenticated visitor is authorised to see. From the development
          perspective, that is what the dashboard boils down to: a filtered,
          read-only summation of data.
        </p>
        <h4>The data input app</h4>
        <p>
          Data input can be a tricky business and for this reason alone, it's
          best kept apart from everything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inputting a tonne of data once a year is a different problem than
          frequent, small additions. Together with security, that's enough for
          one app.
        </p>
        <h4>Single purpose</h4>
        <p>
          It's much easier to maintain small apps that have a clear purpose. It
          is easier to manage new features, release dates, customer updates,
          etc. when there are fewer risks and people involved. Security
          assessments can be made according to risk, sustainability based on use
          and exposure, and accessibility tested more easily and more often.
        </p>
        <h4>Common approach</h4>
        <p>
          Our apps will have much in common: the same framework or strategy,
          common best practices and development processes, shared resources such
          as a design system and component library, authentication and
          authorisation control, and a single team. Beyond that, apps can and
          should be different; they (should) serve disparate needs and be
          tailored accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reducing unnecessary interactions is essential for the improved
          performance, accessibility, security and sustainability (<abbr
            title="Performance, accessibility, security and sustainability"
            >PASS</abbr
          >) of complex web apps.
