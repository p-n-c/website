          <p>We can say a few things about web development and LLMs.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost of web app and page development is high</li>
            <li>Interfaces must adapt to a variety of devices and visitors</li>
            <li>LLMs are widely used by web development teams</li>
            <li>
              LLMs are perceived of as assisting people, but may replace them
            </li>
            <li>LLMs are used to increase productivity and to educate</li>
            <li>
              Companies like OpenAI want to mediate (control) our every
              interaction
            </li>
            <li>
              Things will continue in a similar vein until the means of
              production excludes all but a handful of humans
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Pro di immortales!</h3>
          <p>What happens next, now, or in the near future?</p>
          <p>
            Jakob Nielsen suggested that generative AI could lead to
            <a href="https://www.uxtigers.com/post/accessibility-generative-ui"
              >Individualized UI</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible that web development teams will use LLMs (generative
            AI) to create multiple custom UIs (though the idea has not gone down
            well).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also possible that external LLMs will help people create
            interfaces specific to their needs thereby bypassing our interfaces,
            and us.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this imagined future, for example, online newspapers cease to
            exist. Their content is syndicated by third parties who bundle it
            with other content, wrap the aggregate with meta data (contracts,
            tariffs, advertising) which (a string of) LLMs consume in order to
            render a simulacrum of the original content in the form we demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            A reader's digest might appeal to the reader. They get what the
            want, when they want, it in the format they want.
          </p>
          <p>Things are never that simple. There's always a cost.</p>

              <li>
                All they want in one place. A bespoke newspaper concentrating on
                what they want. No links to stories they're not interested in.

                This feed could be furthered moderated so that it doesn't grow
                endlessly, or older stories are culled.

                Readers can request an audio version (or graphic novel version)
                of an article.
              </li>
              <li>
                Readers can request a synthesis of articles, or a comparative
                analysis that draws out bias.

                Multiple fees and tariffs or a bundled offering. The reader
                doesn't get what they want.
              </li>
              <li>
                Advertising. Either required by the owner or writer of the
                article, or by a syndicate or by the platform or LLM that
                mediates the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Loss of oversight. Provence is buried or obscured, bylines lost
                or subject to controls and deals.
              </li>
              <li>Loss of broader editorial concerns and considerations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This a fragmented world of news. Even more so than today. Imprints
              will no longer have a masthead around which staff can rally.
              Without colleagues, editors, and a common purpose or remit,
              writers are adrift. Free to say what they want but unchallenged,
              and unsupported.
            </p>

              And what of the web development team that maintained the online
              version of the newspaper?
