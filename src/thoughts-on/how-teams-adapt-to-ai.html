          LLM roles: practical as a planning tool and destination as
          interface</p>

            <li>The cost of web app and page development is high</li>
            <li>Interfaces must adapt to a variety of devices and visitors</li>
            <li>
              Visitors, supported by LLMs that are capable of interacting with
              APIs, will be able to create interfaces relevant to user or
              visitor needs and wants thereby bypassing or reducing the role of
              development teams.

          <h3 id="the-value-of-apis">The value of APIs</h3>
        </section>
        <p>
          In the interim, and possibly long term, it will not be possible - or
          desirable - for LLMs to interact directly with databases or have
          knowledge of their internal schema.
        </p>
        <p>
          APIs provide a controlled and safe way access to data whilst
          preserving company privacy and honouring data protection issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional APIs may be augmented to include pricing, design and
          ethics.
