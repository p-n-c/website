        <p>It's easy to get lost during an extended interaction with an LLM.</p>

        <p>
          We start out enthusiastically but after much scrabbling around and
          changes of direction we reach a dead end surrounded by the skeletons
          of unworkable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          One response is to augment the LLM by increasing its context window.
          The alternative is to bolster the human.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            We do this by structuring and documenting human-LLM interactions.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have chosen the metaphor of Ariadne's Thread to describe our
          approach to solving this problem. Ariadne handed the Greek hero
          Theseus a ball of thread before he entered the labyrinth at Knossos so
          that he could retrace his steps after confronting, and killing, the
          Minotaur.
        </p>

          <p>
            Since we often create project prototypes, we're going to use the
            creation of a concept prototype as an example of how to convert an
            interaction into a thread.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to tell the LLM what we want to do and how to document
            progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a
            <a
              href="https://github.com/p-n-c/ariadnes-thread/blob/main/ariadnes-thread/thread-template.md"
              >thread template</a
            >
            to help us. It consists of two parts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Thread definition</strong></p>
              <p>
                This is where we put project specific items: the project title,
                description, the prototype type, and details of what we want to
                do.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>LLM instructions</strong></p>
              <p>
                This is where we put general instructions such as whether the
                LLM should show code, ask questions when in doubt, and whether
                to be succinct or verbose.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also define how the LLM should summarise the interaction to
                date. We call this a <strong>snapshot</strong>. In this case, we
                provide a
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/p-n-c/ariadnes-thread/blob/main/ariadnes-thread/snapshot-schema.json"
                  >snapshot schema</a
                >
                in JSON but it could be a markdown template or free text.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once we have copied our markdown template and saved it, we can use
            it to initialise our interaction by adding or uploading the file.
            Our interaction is now a thread and we can start writing prompts.
          </p>
          <p>
            At any point during the interaction, we can ask the LLM to generate
            a snapshot. We do this when we detect a discernible shift in
            thinking or approach, or when we want to review what we have done.
            We add these snapshots to a
            <strong>thread history</strong>.
          </p>

            <h3 id="workflow">Thread workflow</h3>

              >
              of a thread workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, we embellish or decorate an interaction by adding a
              thread which defines what we want to do and what form the
              interaction should take. The thread template also defines a
              snapshot (the summary the LLM periodically generates at our
              request).
            </p>
            <p>We can now:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Capture progress (decisions made, etc.)</li>
              <li>Ask for a summary of recent interactions</li>
              <li>Go back in the thread to a previous snapshot</li>
              <li>Review the interaction to date (thread history)</li>
              <li>Break down unwieldy interactions into manageable parts</li>
              <li>
                Penetrate further into the labyrinth without fear of pitfalls
              </li>

            <p>
              LLMs are excellent at small, discrete tasks. They are typically
              reliable at convergent thinking (refining ideas) and with a little
              oversight can help speed things along.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also expand our ambitions by plugging gaps (handling
              unfamiliar languages or APIs) and doing heavy lifting (writing
              tests, generating diagrams).
            </p>
            <p>
              They are endlessly patient but they are not cheap. Their cost is
              paid in finite resources such as water, pollution and emissions as
              well as money.

                Ariadne's Thread emerged from two different but complementary
                wishes.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To be independent of LLMs (because of their cost)</li>
                <li>
                  To know where our interactions are taking us (so as to not get
                  lost)
                </li>
              </ul>

            <section aria-labelledby="dependency-avoidance">
              <h4 id="dependency-avoidance">Dependency avoidance</h4>
              <p>
                We use LLMs (quite a lot) but we are not reliant on them. Where
                possible we create something new from our interactions,
                something which does not require their continued presence. We
                think LLMs are valuable but not indispensable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The work on Ariadne's Thread is itself an example of this
                principle in practice; we worked with three LLMs to test its
                viability but we haven't made the solution dependent on having
                access to an LLM.
              </p>

            <section aria-labelledby="critical-thinking">
              <h4 id="critical-thinking">Critical thinking</h4>
              <p>
                Over the past couple of years we have adapted to using LLMs and
                trained ourselves to write concise prompts that specify what we
                want, what we don't want, and how LLMs should respond.
              </p>
              <p>
                Converting an interaction into a thread extends this practice.
                We proceed from prompt to prompt with a definite end in mind and
                when forced to change direction or retrace our steps, we capture
                both our prompts and their responses in a snapshot.
              </p>
              <p>
                By putting more effort and thought into our interactions, we now
                use LLMs less frequently and with better results. And there's
                something more, we increasingly answer our own questions without
                recourse to an LLM.
