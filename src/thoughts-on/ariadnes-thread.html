        <p>It's easy to get lost during an extended chat with an LLM.</p>
        <p>
          As the interaction metastasises, the developer becomes disoriented.
          This is frustrating and wasteful of time, effort and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          One approach is to increase the context window thereby enabling a
          richer and more specific experience or use multiple LLMs, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another, less impactful way. More important than the prompts
          the developer puts to the LLM, are the human prompts they direct
          towards themselves.
        </p>

          <p>
            There is no evidence of spontaneous intelligence in LLMs. The
            developer is solely responsible for what happens, and makes all of
            the decisions. There is therefore an extreme asymmetry between the
            human and the LLM when they work together.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the developer is director, writer and conductor, they must know
            what's going on; they need a goal or a plan, a way to oversee what
            is happening, and a means of getting back on track when the
            discussion deviates.

            <p>
              The interactions described here relate in the main to convergent
              cognitive tasks which are generally more goal-oriented and
              structured.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes to divergent thinking, the developer is advised to
              be sceptical of LLM responses and to not become attached to their
              outpourings.
            </p>
            <p>Whatever the task, use LLMs sparingly.</p>

                While LLMs may provide short-term boosts in creativity during
                assisted tasks, they might inadvertently hinder independent
                creative performance when users are asked to perform without
                assistance. This raises important questions about the long-term
                impact of repeated LLM use on human creativity and cognition.

            <p>
              A prompt thread mediates the interactions between a developer and
              an LLM during the conversion of an idea into a prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the outset of a discussion on prototyping a new idea, the
              developer submits two files:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A

                >
                (PDD)
              </li>
              <li>
                A
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/p-n-c/ariadnes-thread/blob/main/ariadnes-thread/thread-schema.json"
                  >thread schema</a
                >
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Given a <abbr title="Project Prototype Definition">PDD</abbr>, the
              developer and the LLM start their back-and-forth. When a
              significant juncture is reached, the developer asks the LLM to
              generate a thread extension which is a snapshot of progress to
              date but which continues, or extends, the thread of the
              discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The snapshot is disposable and standalone but the developer has
              the option to create a
              <a
                href="https://github.com/p-n-c/ariadnes-thread/blob/main/ariadnes-thread/thread-history-schema.json"
                >thread history</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              A single snapshot, or the entire thread history, are available to
              instigate an interaction with another LLM or another developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each snapshot also marks a pause in - or an end to - the
              interaction, a moment for the developer to collect their thoughts,
              review the decisions they have made, and consider the responses
              they have received before moving on.

            <p>
              There are short-term benefits from using LLMs but it remains true
              that developers, and others, put at risk their ability to think
              critically and creatively when they cede control and direction of
              their projects and ideas to LLMs.
            </p>
            <p>
              LLMs are at their best when we concentrate on the questions we ask
              ourselves. Ariadne's Thread is designed to focus on these human
              prompts, and the oversight we need when interacting with LLMs.
            </p>
            <p>
              LLMs are design grid lines or guides; helpful tools that can be
              removed when the work is done.
            </p>
            <p>
              The question we ask ourselves is not can I do more, but I can I do
              more of what is interesting or novel.
