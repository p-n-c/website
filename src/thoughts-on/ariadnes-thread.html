        <p>It's easy to get lost during an extended interaction with an LLM.</p>

        <p>
          We start out enthusiastically but after much scrabbling around and
          changes of direction we reach a dead end surrounded by the skeletons
          of unworkable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          One response is to augment the LLM by increasing its context window.
          The alternative is to bolster the human.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            We do this by structuring and documenting human-LLM interactions.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have chosen the metaphor of Ariadne's Thread to describe our
          approach to solving this problem. Ariadne handed the Greek hero
          Theseus a ball of thread before he entered the labyrinth at Knossos so
          that he could retrace his steps after confronting, and killing, the
          Minotaur.
        </p>

            <p>
              For the purpose of this discussion, we are going to focus on
              creating a project prototype with the help of an LLM. We expect
              this kind of interaction to generate quite a bit of back and forth
              between the developer and the LLM.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A place for the developer to think outside the interaction
              </li>
              <li>
                A set of guidelines or rules for the LLM to follow during the
                interaction
              </li>
              <li>A way to document the interaction</li>
            </ul>

          <section aria-labelledby="how-to-get-it">
            <h3 id="how-to-get-it">How to get it</h3>
            <p>
              Since we are creating a project, we can create a space inside the
              project to document the interaction. Our project outline and
              interaction rules go there, a record of the interaction and any
              supporting materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              To see what this looks like in practice, take a look at the
              <a
                href="https://github.com/p-n-c/rss-feed-generator/blob/main/artefacts"
                >artefacts directory</a
              >
              for a project prototype that became an npm package we use for
              generating rss feeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've created a tool to help us with this setup, the
              <a href="https://github.com/p-n-c/project-prototype-generator">
                project prototype generator </a
              >. As part of your project setup, this tool will create a thread
              with a prepopulated prompt template and an empty snapshots array.
              All you have to do is fill in the project definition (and there
              are human prompts to guide you).
            </p>
          </section>
          <p>
            We have a
            <a
              href="https://github.com/p-n-c/ariadnes-thread/blob/main/ariadnes-thread/artefacts/thread.json"
              >prompt template</a
            >
            to help us. It consists of two parts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Thread definition</strong></p>
              <p>
                This is where we put project specific items: the project title,
                description, the prototype type, and details of what we want to
                do.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>LLM instructions</strong></p>
              <p>
                This is where we put general instructions such as whether the
                LLM should show code, ask questions when in doubt, and whether
                to be succinct or verbose.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also define how the LLM should summarise the interaction to
                date. We call this a <strong>snapshot</strong>. In this case, we
                provide a
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/p-n-c/ariadnes-thread/blob/main/ariadnes-thread/snapshot-schema.json"
                  >snapshot schema</a
                >
                in JSON but it could be a markdown template or free text.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once we have completed the prompt template, we use it to initialise
            our interaction by adding or uploading the file. Our interaction is
            now a thread and we can start writing prompts.
          </p>
          <p>
            At any point during the interaction, we can ask the LLM to generate
            a snapshot. We do this when we detect a discernible shift in
            thinking or approach, or when we want to review what we have done.
            We add these snapshots to a
            <strong>thread history</strong>.
          </p>
          <section aria-labelledby="workflow">
            <h3 id="workflow">Thread workflow</h3>

              of a thread workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, we embellish or decorate an interaction by adding a
              thread which defines what we want to do and what form the
              interaction should take. The thread template also defines a
              snapshot (the summary the LLM periodically generates at our
              request).
            </p>
            <p>We can now:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Capture progress (decisions made, etc.)</li>
              <li>Ask for a summary of recent interactions</li>
              <li>Go back in the thread to a previous snapshot</li>
              <li>Review the interaction to date (thread history)</li>
              <li>Break down unwieldy interactions into manageable parts</li>
              <li>
                Penetrate further into the labyrinth without fear of pitfalls
              </li>

            <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              LLMs are excellent at small, discrete tasks. They are typically
              reliable at convergent thinking (refining ideas) and with a little
              oversight can help speed things along.
            </p>
            <p>
              They've helped me expand my ambitions by plugging gaps in my
              knowledge (handling unfamiliar languages or APIs) and doing some
              of the heavy lifting (writing tests, generating diagrams).
            </p>
            <p>
              They are endlessly patient but they are not cheap. Their cost is
              paid in finite resources such as water, pollution and emissions as
              well as money.

                Ariadne's Thread emerged from two different but complementary
                wishes.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To be independent of LLMs (because of their cost)</li>
                <li>
                  To document interactions outside of the chat interface so as
                  to avoid getting lost
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 id="dependency-avoidance">Dependency avoidance</h4>
              <p>
                I use LLMs (quite a lot) but I don't want to be reliant on them.
                Where possible I create something new from my interactions,
                something which does not require their continued presence. I
                think LLMs are valuable but not indispensable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The work on Ariadne's Thread is itself an example of this
                principle in practice; I worked with three LLMs to test its
                viability but the solution is not dependent on having access to
                an LLM.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section aria-labelledby="critical-thinking">
              <h4 id="critical-thinking">Critical thinking</h4>
              <p>
                Over the past couple of years I've adapted to using LLMs and
                trained myself to write concise prompts that specify what I
                want, what I don't want, and how I want the LLM to respond.
              </p>
              <p>
                Converting an interaction into a thread extends this practice. I
                proceed from prompt to prompt with a definite end in mind and
                when forced to change direction or retrace my steps, I capture
                progress to date in a snapshot.
              </p>
              <p>
                By putting more effort and thought into my interactions, I use
                LLMs less frequently and with better results. And there's
                something more, I increasingly answer my own questions without
                recourse to an LLM.
