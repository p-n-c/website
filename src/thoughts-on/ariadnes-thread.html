        <p>It's easy to get lost during an extended chat with an LLM.</p>
        <p>
          As the interaction spirals out in different directions, we become
          disoriented. This is frustrating and wasteful of time, effort and
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          One response is to augment the LLM by increasing its context window.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alternative is to bolster the human. We can do this by structuring
          and documenting human-LLM interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have chosen the metaphor of Ariadne's Thread to describe our
          approach to solving this problem. Ariadne handed the Greek hero
          Theseus a ball of thread before he entered the labyrinth at Knossos so
          that he could retrace his steps after confronting, and killing, the
          Minotaur.

          <p>
            A <strong>thread</strong> is a collection of snapshots, or
            representations, of a chat. It summarises decisions, ideas,
            requirements, dependencies, risks, etc. up to that point.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is both a summary of exploratory design steps and a way to track
            changes.
          </p>
          <p>It allows us to explore the labyrinth without getting lost.</p>
          <p>
            By way of example, we have created developer inputs and LLM outputs
            suitable for iterating over designs for a new project via
            <strong>prototypes</strong>
            (conceptual, vertical, functional, etc.).
          </p>
          <h3>Turning our design chat into a prompt thread</h3>
          <p>
            To turn a chat into a prompt thread we pass in a
            <strong>thread definition</strong>
            (what we want to do, and how we want to do it).

              A thread definition prompts us to consider what we want to gain
              from a chat.
            </p>

            <p>
              At any point during the chat, we can ask the LLM to generate a
              snapshot. Do this when you detect a discernible shift in thinking
              or approach, or when you want to review what you have done.
            </p>
            <p>Snapshots have several functions:</p>

              <li>Capture progress (decisions made, etc.)</li>
              <li>

            <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              LLMs are excellent at small, discrete tasks. They are typically
              reliable at convergent thinking (refining ideas) and with a little
              oversight can help speed things along.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also expand our ambitions by plugging gaps (handling
              unfamiliar languages or APIs) and doing heavy lifting (writing
              tests, generating diagrams).
            </p>
            <p>
              They are endlessly patient but they are not cheap. Their cost
              will, at best, be deferred and it will be paid in finite resources
              such as water, pollution and emissions as well as money.
            </p>
            <section aria-labelledby="ariadnes-thread">

              <p>
                Ariadne's Thread emerged from two different but complementary
                wishes.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To be independent of LLMs (because of their cost)</li>
                <li>
                  To know where our chats are taking us (so as to not get lost)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>
            <section aria-labelledby="dependency-avoidance">
              <h4 id="dependency-avoidance">Dependency avoidance</h4>
              <p>
                We use LLMs (quite a lot) but we are not reliant on them. Where
                possible we create something new from our interactions,
                something which does not require their continued presence. We
                think LLMs are valuable but not indispensable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The work on Ariadne's Thread is itself an example of this
                principle in practice; we worked with three LLMs to test its
                viability but we haven't made the solution dependent on having
                access to an LLM.
              </p>

            <section aria-labelledby="critical-thinking">
              <h4 id="critical-thinking">Critical thinking</h4>
              <p>
                LLMs are less good at divergent thinking (creation of novel
                ideas) than they are at convergent thinking but they can still
                be of help.
              </p>
              <p>
                Transforming a chat into a loosely structured prompt thread
                means we can be more ambitious in our thinking.
              </p>
              <p>
                But in order not to perish in the labyrinth, we must first take
                hold of the thread of our reasoning, and hold to it fast.
