      <h1>How to handle LLMs carefully</h1>
      <p>
        Because of the resources LLMs consume, we have an ethical duty to
        consider how we use them.

        <h2>A means not an end</h2>

        <p>
          Conversations with LLMs are costly but may be valuable, the means to
          cover ground previously inaccessible, and to explore ideas otherwise
          beyond an individual or team's reach.
        </p>
        <p>An LLM can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A tool for creating other tools</li>
          <li>A means of iterating over a problem or idea</li>
          <li>A way to explore (and not a crutch)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since the interface is natural language, the conversation is, however,
          two way; LLMs listen as well as speak. Therefore, as we ponder their
          performance, we must consider our own.

          <p>
            This piece is specifically about how web development teams might
            adapt to LLMs. It would be rash to incorporate them into development
            processes. Given their unsuitability for many tasks, and the cost of
            running them, we advise against wrapping them around existing
            practices or embedding them too deeply. Use them instead as we might
            conversations, as a way to explore, discover new approaches, and
            move on. They are useful but disposable though the artefacts we
            create as a result may persist.
          </p>
          <h4>Web development today</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost of web app and page development is high</li>
            <li>Interfaces must adapt to a variety of devices and visitors</li>
            <li>LLMs are widely used by web development teams</li>
            <li>
              LLMs are perceived of as assisting people, but may replace them
            </li>
            <li>LLMs are used to increase productivity and to educate</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Jakob Nielsen has suggested that generative AI could lead to
            <a href="https://www.uxtigers.com/post/accessibility-generative-ui"
              >Individualized UI</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Development teams could use LLMs (generative AI) to create multiple
            custom UIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, an LLM running externally could help a user create an
            interface specific to their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should development teams carry on as though LLMs are a fad, or plan
            for fundamental change?
          </p>

        <section aria-labelledby="the-value-of-apis">
          <h3 id="the-value-of-apis">The value of APIs</h3>
        </section>
        <p>LLMs need data to act upon, and data must be secured.</p>
        <p>
          LLMs cannot be be given unfettered access to databases or have
          knowledge of their internal schema.
        </p>
        <p>
          APIs provide a controlled and safe way access to data whilst
          preserving company privacy and honouring data protection issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          But APIs might form the bridge between what teams do now and what
          might be expected of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the role of the API can be extended. A company contract or
          constitution that expands on an API schema would become the single
          source of truth:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>From which the API is derived</li>
          <li>From which the database scheme is derived</li>
          <li>
            Which front and backend developers use as the contract in
            contract-first development whilst iterating on the API
          </li>
          <li>As the reference point for front and backend tests</li>
          <li>Be the repository for tariffs and pricing details</li>
          <li>
            Be the repository for business rules and statements pertaining to
            ethics, sustainability and accessibility
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Writing and maintaining a schema is hard. It may be possible for
          internal and external LLMs to rely only on API endpoints and examples.
        </p>
        <p>How should teams proceed?</p>
