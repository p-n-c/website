        When working on projects with an LLM, I often became lost, unsure how to
        proceed, and too far from my starting point to retrace my steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I wondered what to do about this, I was reminded of the ball of
        thread Ariadne gave to Theseus. I too needed a thread to guide me.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <h2 id="ariadnes-thread">Ariadne's Thread</h2>
        <p>
          In Greek mythology, the Cretan princess, Ariadne handed Theseus a ball
          of thread before he entered the labyrinth at Knossos so that that he
          might find his way back to safety after confronting, and killing, the
          Minotaur.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        I'm going to jump straight into the problem, how not to get lost when
        interacting with an LLM. I'll use the example of creating a project
        prototype because prototypes are sufficiently complex to require a bit
        of back and forth between a developer and an LLM.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll describe each part of the problem, and it's solution, in turn. At
        the end, we'll see how they fit together.
      </p>

        <p>We need to know what we're going to be talking about.</p>
        <p>
          LLMs like to attach names to things so I prefer to name my project
          upfront. It also helps to give it a short description and a more
          detailed definition. This will benefit me as much as the LLM.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            ><strong>Prompt template</strong>: Used to initialise a thread.
            Contains project-specific details, rules on how an LLM should
            interact and how it should format periodic summaries
            (snapshots).</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the kind of information that typically goes in the initial
          prompt but I'm calling it a prompt
          <em>template</em> because we will use its format repeatedly. In
          addition to the project title, description and definition, I add a
          prototype type and its definition. A conceptual prototype is different
          than a vertical or functional prototype and this helps me sort out my
          thinking before I set out.

        <p>
          My thread is written in JSON. It's a simply structured record of the
          interaction. Here's a basic example:

                    project: {
                      title: 'project title',

                      definition: 'project definition',
                    },
                    prototype: {
                      type: 'prototype',
                      definition: 'prototype definition',
                    },

        <p>
          I'm going to set some ground rules or guidelines for the LLM in my
          prompt. By default I include an explicit direction: "The LLM should
          follow these guidelines throughout". <strong>Rules</strong> govern
          things like whether the LLM should show code by default.
        </p>
        <p>These are particularly effective for pacing the LLM's response:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>confirmBeforeAdvancing</code></li>
          <li><code>explainOneConceptAtATime</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          They cause the LLM to break solutions down into steps and iterate over
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a good idea to remind the LLM of these rules as you go along and
          you can override them at any time. (NB They are not prescriptive;
          tailor them to your needs).
        </p>

        <p>The snapshot is how I keep track of what's going on.</p>
        <p>
          Whenever I want a summary of the interaction to date, need to slow
          things down, or want to record where I am before changing direction, I
          ask the LLM for a snapshot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I choose to keep a record of snapshots by copying and pasting them
          into the snapshots array in my thread. You might store want to share
          them with others or have LLM curate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>snapshot schema</strong> maintains consistency and it's
          primarily for my benefit, not the LLM's. I've written it in a form
          that I find easy to parse, but whether it's in yaml or markdown won't
          make much difference to the LLM.

        You'll notice the snapshot has a copy of the project and prototype
        objects. This reminds the developer and the LLM of the purpose of the
        chat.

          I now have a thread which contains my initial prompt, interaction
          guidelines, and a snapshots array for tracking progress. Where should
          I put it?
        </p>
        <p>
          It makes sense to keep the thread in the project but separate from the
          source code. I add the thread to a new directory,
          <strong>artefacts</strong>, which is where I'll also put files used
          during the interaction as well as code or designs generated by the
          LLM.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can now step away from the chat interface and look over the
          interaction in my own time. It feels much calmer. I have time to
          review code, research any dependencies introduced, and think about
          what I want to do next. It also means I don't copy and paste directly
          into my source code from the chat.

          How does this work in practice? Here's a step-by-step guide for
          creating a thread for a small project or prototype:

        <ul>
          <li>Create a new project</li>
          <li>Add an artefacts directory</li>

            Create a new thread file in artefacts with prompt details,
            interaction rules and how you want the LLM to write snapshots
          </li>
          <li>Open a new chat and upload the thread</li>
          <li>
            Add any files used during the interaction to artefacts, including
            those generated by the LLM
          </li>
          <li>
            When you need a summary of progress to date, ask for a snapshot and
            add it to the snapshots array
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the snapshots and LLM responses inside artefacts to think over
            what you are doing before working on source code and away from the
            distractions of a chat interface

            Example - Building a simple RSS feed generator with Claude

            I used Ariadne's Thread to create a simple RSS feed generator. In

            >
            folder you will find a thread, an example of an RSS feed which I
            added to the chat, and an rss-generator file with code from the LLM.
            Because I had asked Claude to proceed incrementally, it returned
            small chunks of code (numbered 1-4).

          In order not to get lost in the maze of dead-ends and wrong turns
          caused by muddled thinking, I struck on the metaphor of the thread
          which Ariadne gave to Theseus to help him navigate the labyrinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating a thread has the effect of making me think more carefully
          before starting a new project. Its structure and documentation afford
          me better oversight and - if I ask an LLM to assist me - the means to
          moderate our interaction.
