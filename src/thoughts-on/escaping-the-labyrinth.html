        My prompts to LLMs for input sometimes lead to a stream of code and
        explanatory notes that I don't want. It's tempting to try and fix things
        in media res but I usually start over. This affects me in a couple of
        ways: I feel bad that I've wasted resources through my carelessness; the
        mess I've created takes the edge off my enthusiasm.
      </p>
      <p>
        This typically happens when I'm working on a small project; something
        that might require a few files, and a handful of functions. And disaster
        can strike at any moment. I ask for tests but forget to mention that I'm
        using vitest now and not jest, or I fail to stipulate that I want to be
        asked before adding dependencies. Myriad unread lines spool down the
        screen.
      </p>
      <p>Then I remembered the ball of thread Ariadne gave to Theseus.</p>
      <aside>
        <h2 id="ariadnes-thread">Ariadne's Thread</h2>
        <p>
          In Greek mythology, the Cretan princess, Ariadne handed Theseus a ball
          of thread before he entered the labyrinth at Knossos so that that he
          might find his way back to safety after confronting, and killing, the
          Minotaur.

          I will use a <strong>thread</strong> to encapsulate the interactions I
          have with LLMs.
        </p>
        <p>
          My thread is a simply structured record written in JSON. Here's the
          first part of it:

        <section aria-labelledby="the-project">
          <h4 id="the-project">The project</h4>
          <p>
            We start with some information about the project, the sort of things
            you'd expect to find in any prompt: title, description and
            definition. A title helps when discussing the project. The
            definition will depend on what kind of project it is. At this stage,
            it's a prototype and I pick from one of five types: conceptual,
            vertical, horizontal, functional and visual. (Here is a longer list
            of
            <a
              href="https://github.com/p-n-c/ariadnes-thread/blob/main/ariadnes-thread/prototype-types.json"
              >prototype types</a
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            The project and prototype details go in the
            <strong>thread prompt</strong>. It will govern the entire
            interaction related to the project. In nature, it sits somewhere
            between a one off prompt and a systems prompt.
          </p>

            <em

              Contains project-specific details, rules on how an LLM should
              interact and how it should format periodic summaries
              (snapshots).</em

        <section aria-labelledby="interaction-guidelines">
          <h4 id="interaction-guidelines">Interaction guidelines</h4>

          <p>
            The next thing I add to the thread prompt are the
            <strong>interaction guidelines</strong>; ground rules or guidelines
            for the LLM to follow during the interaction. I include an explicit
            direction: "The LLM should follow these guidelines throughout" so
            that their purpose is clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Rules</strong> govern things like whether the LLM should
            show code by default. Two are particularly effective for pacing the
            LLM's response:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>confirmBeforeAdvancing</code></li>
            <li><code>explainOneConceptAtATime</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            They cause the LLM to break solutions down into steps and iterate
            over them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's my updated thread. The thread prompt has been fleshed out to
            include our rules, terms and I've add a new, top-level, field,
            <strong>snapshots</strong>:

        <p>
          Whenever I want a summary of the interaction to date, need to slow
          things down, or want to record where I am before changing direction, I
          ask the LLM for a snapshot.

          I keep a record of snapshots by copying and pasting them into the

        <p>
          The <strong>snapshot schema</strong> describes what these summaries
          should look like. I've written it in JSON because I find it easy to

        You'll notice the snapshot has a copy of the project and prototype
        objects. This reminds the developer and the LLM of the purpose of the
        chat as well as making the snapshot portable.

      <section aria-labelledby="artefacts">

          I now have a thread which contains details of my project, interaction
          guidelines, and a snapshots array for tracking progress. Where should
          I put it?
        </p>
        <p>
          It makes sense to keep the thread in the project itself but separate
          from the source code. I prefer to put the thread in a dedicated
          folder,
          <strong>artefacts</strong>, which is where I'll also add files I add
          to the interaction (e.g. examples of expected outputs) as well as code
          or designs generated by the LLM.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it. The thread initialises my interaction with the LLM. I flip
          between the chat and the project using the files in artefacts as a
          buffer. Working there, away from the distractions and temptations of
          the chat interface, I am self-reliant.

          How does Ariadne's Thread work in practice? Here's a step-by-step
          guide to creating a thread for a small project:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create your project (I use VS Code)</li>
          <li>Add an artefacts folder</li>
          <li>
            Create a new thread prompt in artefacts with project details,
            interaction rules and how you want the LLM to write snapshots
          </li>
          <li>Open a new chat and upload the thread</li>
          <li>
            Add any files used during the interaction to artefacts, including
            those generated by the LLM
          </li>
          <li>
            When you need a summary of progress to date, ask for a snapshot and
            add it to the snapshots array
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the snapshots and LLM responses inside artefacts to think over
            what you are doing before working on source code away from the
            distractions of a chat interface
          </li>

            Example - Building a simple RSS feed generator with Claude
          </h4>
          <p>
            I used Ariadne's Thread to create a simple RSS feed generator. In
            the
            <a
              href="https://github.com/p-n-c/rss-feed-generator/tree/main/artefacts"

            >
            folder you will find a thread, an example of an RSS feed which I
            added to the chat, and an rss-generator file with code from the LLM.
            Because I had asked Claude to proceed incrementally, it returned
            small chunks of code (numbered 1-4) which I evaluated and refactored
            before using in the source code.

          In order not to get lost in the maze of dead-ends and wrong turns
          caused by muddled thinking, I struck on the metaphor of the thread
          which Ariadne gave to Theseus to help him navigate the labyrinth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating a thread has the effect of making me think more carefully
          before starting a new project. Its structure and documentation afford
          me better oversight and - if I ask an LLM to assist me - the means to
          moderate our interaction.

            expedites creating a prototype that supports Ariadne's Thread. When
            you create a new prototype, the artefacts folder and a thread
            complete with thread prompt is included. A list of human prompts

        <p>
          I asked Claude to suggest potential improvements. It touched on many
          of the ideas we have discussed at People and Code, and that my
          colleague, JP, has raised.

          <p>
            Looking at potential improvements for the Ariadne's Thread approach,
            I see several opportunities to enhance its effectiveness:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Version Control Integration - The current implementation relies on
              manually copying snapshots into the thread. Integrating with Git
              or another version control system could automate this process,
              creating commits at each snapshot and maintaining a more reliable
              history.
            </li>
            <li>
              Structured Feedback Loop - Adding a dedicated section in the
              thread for tracking which LLM suggestions worked well and which
              didn't could improve future interactions. This "lessons learned"
              component would help refine prompts over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborative Extensions - The approach seems optimized for solo
              developers. Adding support for team-based workflows, perhaps with
              role-specific guidelines for different team members, would make it
              more versatile for larger projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Templating System - While the article mentions a prototype
              generator, a more robust templating system for different project
              types (web app, CLI tool, data pipeline, etc.) would save time and
              standardize interactions across similar projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Visualization Tools - A simple UI to visualize the thread's
              progression could help identify patterns in the development
              process, showing where the most iterations occurred or where
              progress stalled.
            </li>
            <li>
              Metrics and Analytics - Adding quantitative measures like time
              spent per development phase or the ratio of LLM-generated code
              that makes it to production could provide insights for process
              improvement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cross-LLM Compatibility - The approach could be extended to work
              seamlessly across different LLMs, possibly with adapter patterns
              to normalize the interaction patterns between different AI
              systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Context Window Management - As projects grow, they can exceed the
              context window of many LLMs. A mechanism to intelligently
              summarize or partition the thread while maintaining critical
              context would be valuable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Privacy Controls - For sensitive projects, a filtering mechanism
              to control what information is shared with the LLM would enhance
              security.
            </li>
            <li>
              Machine-Readable Output Format - While JSON is a good start, a
              more strictly defined schema would enable programmatic processing
              of threads, potentially allowing for automated analysis or
              integration with other development tools.
            </li>
          </ul>
