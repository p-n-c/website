          Sometimes interacting with LLMs feels like a walkthrough with someone
          who has never been on stage and who also happens to be our understudy.
        </div>
        <h2>If consequence do but approve my dream</h2>
        <p>
          There is a human and environmental cost to training LLMs. Running them
          consumes resources too. Their output, however, can be valuable. It's a
          question of knowing when to turn to them.
        </p>
        <p>An LLM can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A tool for creating other tools</li>
          <li>A means of iterating over a problem or idea</li>
          <li>A way to explore (and not a crutch)</li>
          <li>A patient cartographer who maps our sprawling ideas</li>
          <li>
            The pawl which stops the ratchet of our thoughts from slipping back
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's also a question of why. An LLM is, like evolution, undirected. To
          get going, LLMs require impetus and direction. But what direction, and
          why. If we are undisciplined we get back nonsense, if we are casual or
          lazy, the response will be anodyne. It's up to us to provide intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          LLMs are literal. They do, as best they can, what we ask. Where our
          request is vague, or poorly phrased, or incomplete, they will find the
          most likely interpretation. This is both good and bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          We interpret what other people say in context. LLMs do something
          similar. (<em
            >The language we use here to describe LLMs may suggest they have
            agency. We don't think they do</em
          >). Unless we want them to guess the context, which can be handy for
          trivial things, it's advisable to fill them in. Remember they know
          nothing about what we want other than what we tell them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also best to do one thing at a time. By all means, brainstorm
          with an LLM. But don't expect it to come up with all the answers. It's
          not a has-all-the-answers machine (although you could ask it to help
          you build one).

          <p>
            Communication with an LLM is a rehearsal for a conversation yet to
            come. We don't always feel in control. LLMs are precocious neophytes
            eager to display their knowledge. They pour out words and code. We
            have to set the stage and determine the pace we want to go at. Keep
            things in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chat is a soliloquy not a dialogue and we perfect it by trying
            out different inflections and new metaphors. The LLM is our
            audience, not the writer.

            Some cuckoos are brood parasites, they lay their eggs in other
            bird's nests. It's in their nature. It's in the nature of tech
            companies to smuggle their interests into our lives. But, like the
            reluctant host of the cuckoo's egg, we can avoid being duped.

          <h4>Intravenous AI</h4>

            I received an email a couple of days ago. This was how it began:

            I haven't enabled GitHub Copilot. I'm not ready to have it on call
            and I don't want to become dependent on something I may not need (I
            haven't until now). Worse, it may distract me from my own thoughts
            and ideas. I prefer to go in search of an LLM when I need it. On the
            way, I will
