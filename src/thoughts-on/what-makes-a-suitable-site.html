        Reducing unnecessary interactions is the starting point for improved

        The first step to improving a site's

          title="Performance, accessibility,
        security and sustainability"

      <h3>Who needs what when</h3>
      <p>
        When we write, we have an audience in mind. This is also true of
        building apps. This article, for example, is aimed at
        <abbr title="Small and medium-sized enterprises">SMEs</abbr> with
        reasonable budgets and experienced teams who want to improve their app's
        <abbr
          title="Performance, accessibility,
        security and sustainability"
          >PASS</abbr
        >. Who is the app's audience?
      </p>
      <h3>Finding your audience</h3>
      <p>
        Or audiences. On a site such as a newspaper that is broadcasting to its
        readership, there may be little variability in the content. An app,
        which is receiving as well as disseminating data, may have multiple
        states, and many ways of engaging with it with, for different reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's imagine how employees at an intergovernmental site monitoring
        carbon emissions might interact with their data.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Big picture: charts, executive summaries, key stats, takeaways</li>
        <li>
          Analysis: interactive charts, models, scenarios, generating reports
          and new requirements, summarising data, picking out key data points
          and writing takeaways
        </li>
        <li>
          Data entry: inputting data, overseeing ingestion of data from
          disparate sources, editing data, validating data, fact checking
          reports
        </li>
        <li>Regulation: auditing data, verifying data, source-checking</li>
        <li>
          Political: ensuring commitments are made and standards adhered to,
          raising concerns, identifying problems, issuing warnings
        </li>
        <li>Public: oversight, providing criticism and feedback</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The data may change little but the person using them, and the access
        they need, will.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem for the development team (and we use this term broadly to
        include everyone contributing to the site, and those marketing and
        promoting it), is to determine who sees what, when, and why. Nor is this
        a one way street; depending on their requirements, our analysts,
        statisticians, politicians and public may need to give up information
        about themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it better to create multiple apps (data entry, analytics, dashboard)
        or variations on a single app? Whatever the decision (and both have pros
        and cons), recognition and anticipation of variable use cases is
        enormously helpful when it comes to writing less code and designing
        simple interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        If teams ignore difference at the outset, contradictions accumulate and
        complexity increases.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we prevent this from happening? The first step is to consider all
        possible user flows and place them in groups. The number of groups is
        critical; the fewer the better so long as no one group becomes a bucket
        for miscellany. This work is not trivial. It benefits from expertise in
        UI and UX but ideally it should involve disparate team members,
        including people who understand human behaviour, data manipulation,
        HTML, screen readers, accessibility, performance, security, SEO,
        marketing, etc. It's a long list.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this is where we may differ from others, as much work explaining,
        documenting and testing solutions as possible should take place
        <em>in the browser</em>.

        The recent introduction of
        <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/"
          >ChatGPT's canvas</a
        >
        coming on top of voice and Internet access may reveal OpenAI's true
        intentions: to become the gateway to the Internet and in the process
        making a great deal of Internet business redundant. The fuss created by
        Jakob Nielsen's article,

          >Accessibility Has Failed: Try Generative UI = Individualized UX</a
