        Sometimes interacting with LLMs feels like reading lines with someone
        who has never been on stage and who is also our understudy.

        <p>
          There is a human and environmental cost to training LLMs. Running them
          consumes resources too. Their output, however, can be valuable. It's a
          question of knowing when to turn to them.
        </p>
        <p>An LLM can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A tool for creating other tools</li>
          <li>A means of iterating over a problem or idea</li>
          <li>A way to explore (and not a crutch)</li>
          <li>A patient cartographer who maps our sprawling ideas</li>
          <li>
            The pawl which stops the ratchet of our thoughts from slipping back
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's also a question of why. An LLM is, like evolution, is undirected.
          To get going, LLMs require impetus and direction. But what direction,
          and why. If we are undisciplined we get back nonsense, if we are
          casual or lazy, the response will be anodyne. It's up to us to provide
          intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          LLMs are literal. They do, as best they can, what we ask. Where our
          request is vague, or poorly phrased, or incomplete, they will find the
          most likely interpretation. This is both good and bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          We interpret what other people say in context. LLMs do something
          similar. (The language we use to describe LLMs sometimes suggest they
          have agency. They don't). Unless we want them to guess the context,
          which can be handy for trivial things, it's best to fill them in.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also best to do one thing at a time. By all means, brainstorm
          with an LLM. But don't expect it to come up with all the answers. It's
          not a has-all-the-answers machine (although you could ask it to help
          you build one).

            Communication with an LLM is a rehearsal for a conversation yet to
            come. We don't always feel in control. LLMs are precocious neophytes
            eager to display their knowledge. They pour out words and code. We
            have to set the stage and the pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chat is soliloquy not dialogue which we perfect by trying out
            different inflections and new metaphors. And for our every
            performance, the LLM provides a new, receptive audience.

            Some cuckoos are brood parasites, they lay their eggs in other
            bird's nests. It's in their nature. It's in the nature of tech
            companies to smuggle their interests into our lives. But, like the
            reluctant host of the cuckoo's egg, we can avoid being duped.

          <p>I received an email this morning. This was how it began:</p>

            I haven't enabled GitHub Copilot. I'm not ready to have it on call
            and I don't want to become depend on something I may not need (I
            haven't until now). Worse, it may distract me from my own thoughts
            and ideas. I prefer to go in search of an LLM when I need it. On the
            way, I will
