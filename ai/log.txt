      <h3 id="the-way-we-work">How we work</h3>
      <p>
        Visitors
        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/jakobs-law-internet-ux/">
          spend most of their time on other sites</a
        >. We like to do the same. When we are working on our own sites, we
        favour time spent in the browser over time spent in the IDE. We're keen
        on extensions (and write them), dev tools, and e2e tests.
      </p>

      <h3>Few dependencies, no surprises</h3>

      <p>
        This site is simple because we didn't want to spend time designing it.
        It is written in semantic, valid HTML, and styled using a small amount
        of CSS. We don't use JavaScript to create pages but we do use it to
        enhance them.
      </p>
      <p>We keep our developer dependencies to a minimum.</p>
      <h3>Our tools</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to useful tools built by others, we have built some of our
        own.

        <p>
          This article makes the case for tackling complexity in web app
          development by creating multiple apps.
        </p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
          Let's imagine how employees at an intergovernmental site monitoring
          carbon emissions might interact with their data.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Big picture</strong>: charts, executive summaries, key
            stats, takeaways
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analysis</strong>: interactive charts, models, scenarios,
            generating reports and new requirements, summarising data, picking
            out key data points and writing takeaways
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data entry</strong>: inputting data, overseeing ingestion of
            data from disparate sources, editing data, validating data, fact
            checking reports
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Regulation</strong>: auditing data, verifying data,
            source-checking
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Political</strong>: ensuring commitments are made and
            standards adhered to, raising concerns, identifying problems,
            issuing warnings
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Public</strong>: oversight, providing criticism and feedback
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The data may change little but the people using them, and the access
          they need, will.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem for the development team (and we use this term broadly to
          include everyone contributing to building, marketing and promoting the
          site), is to determine who sees what, when, and why. Nor is this a one
          way street; depending on their requirements, our analysts,
          statisticians, politicians and public may need to give up information
          about themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it better to create multiple apps (data entry, analytics,
          dashboard, etc.) or variations on a single app? Whatever the decision
          (we will be putting the case for multiple apps), understanding the
          needs of users is necessary for writing less code and designing
          simpler interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          If teams ignore differences at the outset, contradictions accumulate
          and complexity increases.
        </p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          How do we prevent this from happening? The first step is to consider
          all possible user flows and place them in groups. The number of groups
          is critical; the fewer the better so long as no one group becomes a
          bucket for miscellany.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's another way to break down our
          <a
            href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/building-user-segmentation-matrix-foster-cross-org-alignment/"
            >user segments</a
          >:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Who needs what data?</strong> Some users require high-level
            summaries (executives, public), while others need in-depth
            interaction with the data (analysts, auditors).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How frequently do they interact with the app?</strong>
            For example, data entry might happen daily, while audits might occur
            quarterly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What level of technical expertise do they have?</strong>
            Data entry operators might need a simplified interface, while
            analysts may require complex data manipulation tools.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This work is not trivial. It benefits from expertise in UI and UX but
          ideally it should involve disparate team members, including people who
          understand human behaviour, data manipulation, HTML, screen readers,
          accessibility, performance, security, SEO, marketing, etc. It's a long
          list.
        </p>
        <h3>The matrix of needs</h3>
        <p>
          Writing down the needs of different users is a pretty clear
          requirement. How else would we know what to build? Once we have that
          information, we can use it in multiple ways because we are programmers
          and designers and studiers of human behaviour. We can show where there
          is overlap, which items are unique, what is universal, and we can rank
          requirements in multiple ways such as necessity, risk, development
          time, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>
          Not everyone likes meetings but without informed, critical discussion,
          problems will emerge that could have been prevented. Here are some of
          the benefits of (long) meetings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job titles become less important</li>
          <li>
            Everyone gets a chance to speak (if the meeting is sufficiently
            long)
          </li>
          <li>Solutions bubble up as workable ideas replace opinions</li>
          <li>Consensus is derived not imposed</li>
          <li>New thinking emerges</li>
          <li>Collaboration improves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          It's a principle, not only held by developers, that it's a bad idea to
          repeat yourself. This is a good argument in favour of components.
          Components are used multiple times. A button component might be used
          hundreds, or thousands of times, and it will allow for a certain
          amount of variety.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's tempting to have one app because it feels like a lot of effort to
          have more. But it needn't be, especially if a team knows why they have
          multiple apps, and are comfortable building and maintaining them
          (working from, perhaps, a template generator). Apps aren't that hard
          to build; the problem is what to show and what not to show, and to
          whom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to stop a visitor going where you don't want them to go,
          or from doing what you don't want them to, is to remove that
          particular option. This is also a good rule for development teams.
        </p>
        <p>Here is how we might tackle two of our apps.</p>
        <h4>The dashboard app</h4>
        <p>
          In our hypothetical app, we make everyone's life easier, by building a
          separate app for the dashboard. It consumes data (it's read only), it
          might not need a menu, and it can expand to fill the screen. It won't
          be hard to display data by region, and to work out how much the
          authenticated visitor is authorised to see. From the development
          perspective, that is what the dashboard boils down to: a filtered,
          read-only summation of data.
        </p>
        <h4>The data input app</h4>
        <p>
          Data input can be a tricky business and for this reason alone, it's
          best kept apart from everything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inputting a tonne of data once a year is a different problem than
          frequent, small additions. Together with security, that's enough for
          one app.
        </p>
        <h4>Single purpose</h4>
        <p>
          It's much easier to maintain small apps that have a clear purpose. It
          is easier to manage new features, release dates, customer updates,
          etc. when there are fewer risks and people involved. Security
          assessments can be made according to risk, sustainability based on use
          and exposure, and accessibility tested more easily and more often.
        </p>
        <h4>Common approach</h4>
        <p>
          Our apps will have much in common: the same framework or strategy,

        Pages have weight, some more than others, and
        <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesTotal"
          >the median size is growing</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Measuring emissions associated with page weight is a relatively new
        practice and given the number of factors to be controlled for, any
        values should be regarded as estimates.
      </p>
      <p>
        But estimates are sufficient to compare pages across sites and for
        development teams to use them to compare versions of their pages over
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping an eye on emissions also means being aware of the individual
        requests that make up a page. This number is in the hundreds for sites
        that pull in data from many sources and employ third party tracking and
        advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emissions tracker lets visitors view requests and emissions in real
        time, as the page loads.
      </p>
      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The extension relies on the service worker to monitor and process
        requests and the side panel to display them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers"
          ><strong>service worker</strong></a
        >
        has access to indexedDB (the browser’s built-in database) but not the
        DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        This
        <a
          href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel"
          ><strong>side panel</strong></a
        >
        has access to the Window object and Chrome's APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a visitor first opens the extension by clicking on the icon, they
        are asked to refresh the page to begin tracking emissions. Thereafter
        one of three scenarios takes place.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scenarios</strong>: The extension keeps tracking emissions as
          new requests come in but when the page is reloaded or the visitor
          navigates to a new site, we:
          <ul>
            <li>Clear the indexedDB store</li>
            <li>Reset the display in the side panel</li>
          </ul>
          When the visitor clicks on a different, already open, tab, we:
          <ul>
            <li>Clear the indexedDB store</li>
            <li>Close the side panel</li>
            <li>Disable request listeners</li>
          </ul>
          We disable the listeners because service workers
          <a
            href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers"
            >generally run</a
          >
          until the browser is closed or the extension is removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Initial state</strong>: Every time the visitor opens the side
          panel by clicking on the extension icon, we show the message "Please
          reload the page to capture website emissions". This is necessary
          because we don't have access to 'historical' requests i.e. requests
          made before the extension service worker was initialised.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Service worker</h2>
      <p>
        The extension service worker is responsible for intercepting requests,
        storing them, processing them (sorting, etc.) and messaging the side
        panel.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code><strong>fetch(url)</strong></code
          >: The service worker intercepts requests using the fetch API.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><strong>response.clone()</strong></code
          >: Clone the response because a Response object can only be consumed
          once. Cloning lets you keep the original response intact while
          processing a copy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><strong>indexedDB</strong></code
          >: Save request information to indexedDB so that the data can be read
          back and processed e.g. sorted and grouped.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><strong>chrome.runtime.sendMessage</strong></code
          >: The service worker messages the side panel after every request with
          a fresh data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Side panel</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code><strong>chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener</strong></code
          >: The side panel listens for messages from the service worker. It is
          responsible for displaying a summary (bytes, request count, associated
          emissions and whether the site is green hosted), request details
          grouped by <code>type</code>, and listing failed requests.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Request size (bytes transferred)</h2>
      <p>
        Unless the server responsible for serving a cross-origin request has set
        <a href="Access-Control-Expose-Headers"
          ><code>Access-Control-Expose-Headers</code></a
        >
        the content length is 0. In order to find bytes transferred, we need to
        look at the content length and then, if compression has been used, apply
        it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance API</strong>: We cannot use the Performance API
          because
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming"
            >transferSize is 0</a
          >
          for cross-origin requests where the appropriate
          <abbr title="Cross-Origin Resource Sharing">CORS</abbr> headers have
          not been set e.g.
          <code>Timing-Allow-Origin: https://developer.mozilla.org</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><strong>fetch(url)</strong></code
          >: Where available, we use content-length, and, if not, byte length.
          Since this value is the original size of the resource, we have to
          compress it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compression strategy</strong>: Given the size in bytes of the
          original resource, resource type (CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and the
          encoding type (brotli, gzip, etc.) we estimate the size of the
          compressed, transferred, size of the resource. Compression rates for
          resources vary between sites due to server behaviour, so we select
          compression levels, and rates, that are representative. For some
          sites, the resulting byte value may be high or low.
          <pre>
            <code>
              const compressionRate = getCompressionStrategy( requestType,
              encoding, uncompressedBytes ).rate
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice</strong>: Due to uncertainty around compression rates
          and emissions calculations, the tracker is most useful for comparing
          values between different versions of the same site.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How emissions are calculated</h2>
      <h3>The Green Web Foundation (TGWF)</h3>
      <p>
        Once we have a byte count, we can calculate its associated emissions.
        <abbr title="The Green Web Foundation">TGWF</abbr> provides a useful set
        of methods and a clear
        <a href="https://sustainablewebdesign.org/estimating-digital-emissions/"
          >methodology</a
        >. We recommend using <a href="https://ecograder.com/">Ecograder</a> for
        a comparative analysis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In order to use the
          <a href="https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/methods/"
            >methods</a
          >
          provided by the <abbr title="The Green Web Foundation">TGWF</abbr>, I
          forked the
          <a href="https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js/">repo</a>,
          and copied the build files generated by running
          <code>npm run build</code>. We imported <code>hosting</code> and
          <code>co2</code> into the project.
        </li>
        <li>
          A call to <code>hosting.check(domain)</code> returns a boolean value
          for <code>greenHosting</code>, displayed as "green hosted".
        </li>
        <li>
          A call to <code>CO2.perByte(bytes, greenHosting)</code> returns a
          value for emissions in g (grams) of CO2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparison with previous</strong>: If the visitor previously
          saved data (in the side panel's Local storage), current data are
          compared against them. An arrow up (red) indicates a rise (in
          emissions, requests or bytes), and an arrow down (green) a fall.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exporting data</strong>: Clicking on the "Export data" button
          results in the option to save the summary and requests grouped by type
          to a local file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Overriding compression rates</strong>: There is a pending
          feature request to override the default rates with custom rates better
          tailored to the visitor's needs (the compression rates used on a
          site). Since compression strategy is an object literal, overrides
          could be exported in JSON format.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The cost of our actions is of general interest and the emissions tracker
        provides a simple way to see the impact of a web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emissions tracker is also an inducement to development teams to
        spend more time looking at how their web sites and apps behave in the
        browser where they are used and seen by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        At People and Code we spend a lot of time in the browser and build tools
        to help us there.

              <em>Outcome</em>: When a PR is made, the author is assigned and a
              list of reviewers is generated. In our case (People and Code), the
              reviewer is automatically assigned because there is only one
              reviewer on the list who is not the author.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Make sure you have direct repository access before doing the
              following
              <pre><code>git fetch origin                    # Download information about all remote branches 
git switch origin/branch-name     # Switch to the specific PR branch (Detached HEAD state)</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to make changes while reviewing, create a local branch
              <pre><code>git switch -c my-review-branch origin/branch-name</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Update your local main branch with the merged changes
              <pre><code>git switch main                   # Switch to main branch
git fetch origin                    # Get latest remote information

            </li>
            <li>
              Clean up by removing your review branch if you created one

          <ul>

              For shared branches in PRs, use <code>merge</code>. It preserves
              history but adds complexity.
              <pre><code>git switch main
git pull origin main
git switch your-branch-name
git merge main</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              For personal branches, used <code>rebase</code>. It creates a
              cleaner history by rewriting it.
              <pre><code>git switch main
git pull origin main
git switch your-branch-name
git rebase main</code></pre>

          <h2 id="key-points">Key Points to Remember</h2>
          <p>
            When reviewing pull requests locally, remember these important
            practices:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Always start with a fetch to ensure you have the latest remote
              information
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't worry about being in a detached HEAD state - it's normal
              when checking out remote branches directly
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a local branch if you need to make changes during review
            </li>
            <li>
              Clean up your local branches after PRs are merged to keep your
              repository tidy
            </li>
            <li>Use merge for shared branches and rebase for personal work</li>
            <li>
              Run git fetch --prune periodically to clean up references to
              deleted remote branches
            </li>
          </ul>

              I pledge to put down my ideas on paper before asking for help from

              <span
                >in order that I will produce better work in the same amount of

        </section>
        <section aria-labelledby="intention">
          <h3 id="intention">Intention</h3>
          <p>
            Why did I make this pledge? I use
            <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> and
            <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> a lot. I know they
            consume energy, create emissions, and use water both during their
            training phase and when they are running.
          </p>
          <p>
            The numbers for these operations (our calculations) are probably of
            the correct magnitude but their significance is not clear to me.
            Comparing the training of an LLM to X number of flights doesn't tell
            me whether the training should have gone ahead, or whether I should
            use the model. Should the flights have flown? Were they for a good
            reason? What is a lot of flights?
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if I knew the answer to these questions, I don't think it would
            matter. If LLMs are useful - and they are - we are going to use
            them. If the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox"
              >Jevons paradox</a
            >
            applies, we will use LLMs - or generative AI - to do more, whether
            that more is valuable or not.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section aria-labelledby="hypothesis">
          <h3 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h3>
          <p>
            Therefore, I am looking at this the other way around. Rather than
            monitor my LLM usage, I will keep a watchful eye on my intentions.
            The idea is to know my goal in advance and use LLMs to achieve the
            task in less time, or to do it better. Ideally both things would be
            true.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am assuming that by doing things quicker or better, I will save
            energy (and by association emissions, water, etc.).

          <p>I don't know how to measure the outcome of this pledge.</p>
          <p>
            I will therefore measure success by whether or not I do write things
            down. I can verify that. In addition, I <em>aspire</em> to work
            faster and better. This approach is unscientific but still, I think
            valid, because the pledge is really about my - human - behaviour,
            not whether or not AI can help me.

            The outcome section was written after I asked Claude what it
            thought. I didn't change anything. Here is part of its reply:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              This reminds me of other situations where the act of preparation
              or reflection itself can be more valuable than any measurable
              outcome. For instance, the practice of writing a project brief
              often clarifies thinking regardless of whether the final product
              strictly follows that brief.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The EU Accessibility Act (EAA) is a directive set to take effect on
          28th June 2025. Its primary goal is to enhance the accessibility of a
          wide range of products and services across the European Union.
        </p>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Applies to</strong>:
            <div>The public and private sector</div>
            <div>
              Any business that wishes to trade in the EU, wherever it is based
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Includes</strong>: Websites, mobile apps, and web
            applications
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Covers</strong>: Consumer-facing (B2C). It does not apply to
            business-to-business (B2B) services unless they also serve external
            users.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Exemptions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Micro-enterprises</strong>: Generally exempt. A
            micro-enterprise has fewer than 10 employees and turnover below €2
            million
            <div><em>Voluntary adoption is encouraged</em></div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Products or services provided before 28 June 2025 are exempt for up
            to five years or until any relevant contract expires.
          </li>
          <li>Software updates are not exempt.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Key Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adherence to established accessibility standards. Meeting WCAG 2.1
            Level AA ensures compliance.
            <div>
              <em>Please note WCAG 2.2 is officially a W3C recommendation</em>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Improvements may include:
            <ul>
              <li>Enhanced compatibility with assistive technologies</li>
              <li>Improved keyboard navigability</li>
              <li>Accessible visual content</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The four principles of accessibility of websites and mobile
            applications are:
            <dl>
              <dt><strong>Perceivability</strong></dt>
              <dd>
                Meaning that information and user interface components must be
                presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
              </dd>
              <dt><strong>Operability</strong></dt>
              <dd>
                Meaning that user interface components and navigation must be
                operable.
              </dd>
              <dt><strong>Understandability</strong></dt>
              <dd>
                Meaning that information and the operation of the user interface
                must be understandable.
              </dd>
              <dt><strong>Robustness</strong></dt>
              <dd>
                Meaning that content must be robust enough to be interpreted
                reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive
                technologies.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </li>
          <li>
            Accessibility should be achieved by the systematic removal and
            prevention of barriers, preferably through a universal design or
            <strong>Design for All</strong> (DfA) approach.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Compliance Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deadline</strong>: June 28th 2025</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Penalties</strong>: Vary by member state, may include:
            <ul>
              <li>Fines</li>
              <li>Product removal from market</li>
              <li>Legal action</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compliance Costs</strong>: May involve:
            <ul>
              <li>Redesigning digital products</li>
              <li>Staff training</li>
              <li>Ongoing monitoring</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Impact on Different Businesses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Simple websites</strong>: May require minimal adjustments
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complex platforms</strong>: Might need substantial
            revisions, especially those providing:
            <ul>
              <li>Essential services</li>
              <li>
                Intricate data analysis (e.g. emissions data recording and
                analysis)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The EAA represents a significant step towards digital inclusivity in
          the EU. Businesses must prepare for compliance to avoid penalties and
          ensure their products and services are accessible to all, including
          people with disabilities.

          To ensure the full participation of people with disabilities in
          society, and to reduce the fragmentation of legislation governing
          access to products and services, the European Commission has adopted a

          Design for All is a concept that describes a wide range of design
          approaches, methods, techniques and tools for designers to meet the
          vast diversity of users’ needs and requirements. Designers strive to
          build access features into products from the start of their design
          process. IxDF

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This article is intended for teams using or planning to use AI on
          their websites and apps. It provides an overview of risk,
          requirements, governance, and how to achieve compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of obligations fall on providers or developers of
          high-risk AI systems but developers of apps, including those using AI
          for educational purposes, may be involved in work that is classed as
          minimal risk, and is therefore subject to (lighter) obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following summary of risk and requirements is taken from the
          <a
            href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence"
            >summary</a
          >
          provided by the European Parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new rules establish obligations for providers and users depending
          on the level of risk from artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <h3>Unacceptable risk</h3>
        <p>Don't do these things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cognitive behavioural manipulation of people or specific vulnerable
            groups
          </li>
          <li>Social scoring</li>
          <li>Biometric identification and categorisation of people</li>
          <li>
            Real-time and remote biometric identification systems, such as
            facial recognition
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Article 5 of the act covers
          <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/5/"
            >prohibited AI practices</a
          >
          in detail.
        </p>
        <h3>High risk</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Category 1</em> is concerned with products such as lifts,
          medicines and planes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some areas of <em>Category 2</em> are specialised but others may be of
          relevance to developers of certain kinds of software.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are involved in any of the following, find out what your
          obligations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Management and operation of critical infrastructure</li>
          <li>Education and vocational training</li>
          <li>Employment, worker management and access to self-employment</li>
          <li>
            Access to and enjoyment of essential private services and public
            services and benefits
          </li>
          <li>Law enforcement</li>
          <li>Migration, asylum and border control management</li>
          <li>
            Assistance in legal interpretation and application of the law.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Transparency requirements</h2>
        <h3>Use of Generative AI</h3>
        <p>
          While not classified as high-risk, the use of Generative AI, like
          ChatGPT, will have to comply with transparency requirements and EU
          copyright law.
        </p>
        <p>You can comply by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disclosing that the content was generated by AI</li>
          <li>
            Designing the model to prevent it from generating illegal content
          </li>
          <li>Publishing summaries of copyrighted data used for training</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            High-impact general-purpose AI models that might pose systemic risk,
            such as the more advanced AI model GPT-4, would have to undergo
            thorough evaluations and any serious incidents would have to be
            reported to the European Commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Content that is either generated or modified with the help of AI -
            images, audio or video files (for example deepfakes) - need to be
            clearly labelled as AI generated so that users are aware when they
            come across such content.
          </p>
          <cite

        <h3>How should AI generated content be labelled?</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/v4mfz"
            >What label should be applied to content produced by generative
            AI?</a
          >
          by Epstein et al., considered how nine labels are perceived by people
          in the US, Mexico, Brazil, India, and China.
        </p>
        <p>The paper is worth a read, here is a flavour of it:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>AI generated</strong>,
            <strong>Generated with an AI tool</strong>, and
            <strong>AI Manipulated</strong> are the terms that participants most
            consistently associated with content that was generated using AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if the goal is to identify content that is misleading
            (e.g., our second research question), these terms perform quite
            poorly. Instead, <strong>Deepfake</strong> and

          An All-Purpose API (AP-API) embraces all that an entity is and does.
          It extends the traditional
          <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> which
          handles domain data (books, native wildflowers, films) to include
          things about an entity itself, and how that entity would like others
          to interact with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, we consider how we might protect an API from being
          cannibalised by multiple external interests (LLM agents). By adding
          context to our API we influence how our data are used.

          <p>
            LLMs need data to act on, and data must be secure. LLMs cannot be
            given unfettered access to databases or have knowledge of their
            internal schema.
          </p>
          <p>
            APIs provide a controlled and safe way to access data whilst
            preserving an entity's privacy and honouring data protection issues.
          </p>
          <p>An AP-API works on the same principles as an API.</p>

            <h3 id="internal-value-of-ap-apis">Internal value of AP-APIs</h3>

            <p>An AP-API is the single source of truth:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>From which the API is derived</li>
              <li>From which the database scheme is derived</li>
              <li>
                Which front and backend developers use as the contract in
                contract-first development whilst iterating on the API
              </li>
              <li>Is the reference for front and backend tests</li>

            <p>Additionally it is:</p>

              <li>
                A conduit for information from other systems e.g. bug tracking

            <p>
              Because an AP-API adds to an API, it is attractive to LLMs which
              are gluttons for data.

              The AP-API is an opportunity for web development teams to
              articulate different modes of presentation and to take the lead on
              how their data should be used, explored, exploited and processed.

            <p>
              <em>
                APIs are typically defined by a schema but endpoints and
                examples are probably enough for LLMs to work out what to do.
                Which is good news for web development teams because schemas are
                not trivial.

                Converting an API into an AP-API

              <p>
                An API is-an AP-API. You don't have to change anything. But you
                might want to so that the world knows more about you.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's a good way to document (in a serious, maintainable way) how
                the different parts of your entity work. This will help them
                better communicate with one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                It can also be used to support non-technical parts of an entity
                such as sales and marketing.
              </p>
              <p>
                An AP-API encourages a rethinking of how we want our data to
                appear in the world. It's unlikely that it will be via
                'monolithic' apps or sites. This has a huge knock-on effect on
                job titles, team dynamics, tooling, etc.

          <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The reason for an AP-API is to prepare us for a digital future in
            which traditional sites and apps are replaced by LLMs that consume
            data from multiple sources and create custom interfaces for their
            clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because an AP-API is-an API it is the sine qua non of contract-first
            development, and the interface for mediating requests from and
            responses to known consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
            An AP-API is also how we shape future discourse with LLMs. In order
            to have some say in how our data are presented, we (entities)
            provide context to our data through the AP-API. This might take the
            form of lots of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget">widgets</a>, or
            public components that can be assembled in multiple ways.

          </p>
          <p>
            A word of caution. The value of LLMs is unclear in most cases. Do
            not become overly reliant on them. Treat LLMs as disposable.

      <div class="subtitle">From Protocols to Natural Language Contracts</div>
      <p>
        Within the next decade, automated AI agents will mediate most web
        browsing. In such a paradigm, the owners of content will have little or
        no control over the user interface and experience. This shift requires
        rethinking how we structure web interactions so consumer-side agents can
        communicate effectively with their content owner-side counterparts. We
        propose moving from rigid protocols to natural language contracts that
        both humans and AI can understand and negotiate.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

      <p>
        Natural language contracts between AI agents require three fundamental
        properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Observability: Established during handshake between consumer and data
          owner
        </li>
        <li>
          Verifiability: Using blockchain or repositories for verification
        </li>
        <li>
          Privity: Knowledge distribution limited to necessary parties (privacy
          is one component of maintaining privity)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Having a publicly available contract creates a focal point - a default
        solution both parties understand without detailed communication. Unlike
        traditional APIs embedded in interfaces, these contracts can be adapted
        through AI negotiation while maintaining security through established
        verification mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>The Evolution of Web Contracts</h2>

      <p>
        The web's development shows a clear progression toward more flexible
        interactions. Initially, protocols provided unambiguous but rigid rules
        for machine-to-machine communication. APIs followed, offering more
        flexibility while remaining machine-first. Now, natural language
        contracts represent the next step - agreements that humans can read and
        AI can execute.
      </p>

      <p>
        This evolution trades unambiguity for flexibility, enabling richer
        interactions through controlled ambiguity. AI agents make this trade-off
        valuable by bridging human and machine understanding.
      </p>

      <h2>AI Agents as Contract Mediators</h2>

      <p>
        AI agents serve as ideal mediators because they communicate in natural
        language while understanding machine code. This dual capability enables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Concatenation of information from different sources</li>
        <li>Interface-agnostic interactions</li>
        <li>
          Reduced interface costs between human/software and software/software
        </li>
        <li>Natural clarification of ambiguities</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For example, when a bank requests personal information, traditional
        smart contracts must specify exact cryptographic requirements. With AI
        mediation, the contract can remain implementation-agnostic while
        ensuring security through negotiation.
      </p>

      <h2>Verification and Security</h2>

      <p>
        While embracing natural language flexibility, these contracts maintain
        security through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blockchain resilience via decentralised networks</li>
        <li>Integrity through open source protocols</li>
        <li>Public transparency</li>
        <li>Consensus-based modification</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This framework preserves trust while allowing implementation details to
        emerge through AI negotiation.
      </p>

      <h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>

      <p>
        The shift to natural language contracts introduces several
        considerations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Knowledge loop concerns in AI-mediated content</li>
        <li>Content reliability verification</li>
        <li>Intellectual property protection</li>
        <li>Service provider brand identity preservation</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity safeguards</li>
        <li>Potential increase in contract-related litigation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Open Questions</h2>

      <p>
        As we move toward AI-mediated web interactions, several questions
        require exploration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How do we ensure contract fulfillment while maintaining flexibility?
        </li>
        <li>What mechanisms enable contract discovery between agents?</li>
        <li>How do we handle controversial information and disputes?</li>
        <li>
          How can natural language contracts maintain security without
          specifying implementation details?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can we ensure the segregation of duty between the parties in a
          context where there are only a few major providers of AI agents?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The transition from protocols to natural language contracts mediated by
        AI agents offers more flexible, human-readable web services while
        preserving machine executability. This evolution promises to reshape how
        we interact with web services. However, the inherent tension between
        natural language ambiguity and secure machine execution remains a
        fundamental challenge to overcome.

          We begin by imagining that LLMs are gatekeepers to the latest
          iteration of Internet portals (after AOL, Flash, etc). Instead of
          visiting sites and downloading apps, we (users, readers, people)
          funnel everything through Claude or ChatGPT or some other intermediary
          that assembles a multitude of LLMs in order to trawl the Internet for
          data which they synthesise and repackage as they see fit. We pay for
          this and/or the advertising that accompanies it.

          <p>We can say a few things about web development and LLMs.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The cost of web app and page development is high</li>
            <li>Interfaces must adapt to a variety of devices and visitors</li>
            <li>LLMs are widely used by web development teams</li>
            <li>
              LLMs are perceived of as assisting people, but may replace them
            </li>
            <li>LLMs are used to increase productivity and to educate</li>
            <li>
              Companies like OpenAI want to mediate (control) our every
              interaction
            </li>
            <li>
              Things will continue in a similar vein until the means of
              production excludes all but a handful of humans

          </ul>

            Jakob Nielsen suggested that generative AI could lead to
            <a href="https://www.uxtigers.com/post/accessibility-generative-ui"
              >Individualized UI</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is possible that web development teams will use LLMs (generative
            AI) to create multiple custom UIs (though the idea has not gone down
            well).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also possible that external LLMs will help people create
            interfaces specific to their needs thereby bypassing our interfaces,
            and us.

            In this imagined future, for example, online newspapers cease to
            exist. Their content is syndicated by third parties who bundle it
            with other content, wrap the aggregate with metadata (contracts,
            tariffs, advertising) which (a string of) LLMs consume in order to
            render a simulacrum of the original content in the form we (the
            reader) demand.

          <p>
            A reader's digest might appeal to the reader. They get what the

              This is a fragmented world of news. For readers and for writers.
              Imprints will no longer have a masthead around which staff can
              rally. Without colleagues, editors, and a common purpose or remit,
              writers are adrift. Free to say what they want but unchallenged,

            <p>
              Web development contract work pays well. It's easier to make a
              living as a freelance programmer than as a freelance writer. But
              if the mainstays of digital life, sites and apps, are no longer
              relevant (wanted or needed), contracted and freelance developers,
              designers, product managers, UX specialists, QAs, etc. will
              confront a changed world where some of what they know is
              redundant.

            <p>
              Tools, processes, and environments are secondary to the know-how
              in communicating via digital interfaces. If control over those
              interfaces is not wrested from them (us), colleagues must work
              together on finding new ways to communicate, demonstrating that
              their (our) experience should not be carelessly discarded.

              <p>
                We foresee upheaval in web development. If we do not imagine new
                ways of doing things, we will have little influence over what
                happens next. If we do, we can invent new roles and participate
                in change.

          Sometimes interacting with LLMs feels like a walkthrough with someone
          who has never been on stage and who also happens to be our understudy.
        </div>
        <h2>If consequence do but approve my dream</h2>
        <p>
          There is a human and environmental cost to training LLMs. Running them
          consumes resources too. Their output, however, can be valuable. It's a
          question of knowing when to turn to them.
        </p>
        <p>An LLM can be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A tool for creating other tools</li>
          <li>A means of iterating over a problem or idea</li>
          <li>A way to explore (and not a crutch)</li>
          <li>A patient cartographer who maps our sprawling ideas</li>
          <li>
            The pawl which stops the ratchet of our thoughts from slipping back
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's also a question of why. An LLM is, like evolution, undirected. To
          get going, LLMs require impetus and direction. But what direction, and
          why. If we are undisciplined we get back nonsense, if we are casual or
          lazy, the response will be anodyne. It's up to us to provide intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          LLMs are literal. They do, as best they can, what we ask. Where our
          request is vague, or poorly phrased, or incomplete, they will find the
          most likely interpretation. This is both good and bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          We interpret what other people say in context. LLMs do something
          similar. (<em
            >The language we use here to describe LLMs may suggest they have
            agency. We don't think they do</em
          >). Unless we want them to guess the context, which can be handy for
          trivial things, it's advisable to fill them in. Remember they know
          nothing about what we want other than what we tell them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also best to do one thing at a time. By all means, brainstorm
          with an LLM. But don't expect it to come up with all the answers. It's
          not a has-all-the-answers machine (although you could ask it to help
          you build one).
        </p>
        <section aria-labelledby="waiting-for-god-2.0">
          <h3 id="waiting-for-god-2.0">Waiting for God 2.0</h3>
          <p>
            Communication with an LLM is a rehearsal for a conversation yet to
            come. We don't always feel in control. LLMs are precocious neophytes
            eager to display their knowledge. They pour out words and code. We
            have to set the stage and determine the pace we want to go at. Keep
            things in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chat is a soliloquy not a dialogue and we perfect it by trying
            out different inflections and new metaphors. The LLM is our
            audience, not the writer.

            Some cuckoos are brood parasites, they lay their eggs in other
            bird's nests. It's in their nature. It's in the nature of tech
            companies to smuggle their interests into our lives. But, like the
            reluctant host of the cuckoo's egg, we can avoid being duped.

          <h4>Intravenous AI</h4>
          <p>
            I received an email a couple of days ago. This was how it began:

            I haven't enabled GitHub Copilot. I'm not ready to have it on call
            and I don't want to become dependent on something I may not need (I
            haven't until now). Worse, it may distract me from my own thoughts
            and ideas. I prefer to go in search of an LLM when I need it. On the
            way, I will

This CSS file provides a minimalist, grayscale styling that is responsive and accessible. It uses variables for easy customization of colors and maintains a consistent look across different pages.

For the HTML files, I would suggest the following modifications:

1. Ensure all images have appropriate `alt` text for accessibility.
2. Use semantic HTML elements consistently across all pages (e.g., `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`).
3. Add `aria-label` attributes to navigation elements for better screen reader support.
4. Consider adding a "skip to main content" link at the beginning of each page for keyboard accessibility.
5. Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.) is maintained on all pages.
6. Use `<time>` elements for dates where appropriate.
7. Consider adding `aria-labelledby` attributes to sections to improve structure for screen readers.

These modifications will enhance the accessibility and semantic structure of the HTML without changing the overall content or layout.
